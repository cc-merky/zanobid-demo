          Please read this before using the zanobid website or submitting any personal information therein. The following Privacy Policy outlines the information zanobid may collect and how we may use it.<br/><br/>
          
          We acknowledge and respect your personal privacy, according to statutory regulations, in particular, the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation [NDPR] 2019, the Nigeria Constitution among others.<br/><br/>
          
          We do need some personal information from you so that you can actively participate in zanobid’s Auctions. We collect only the Personal Information you provide to us. We would therefore like to request that you agree to the collection and storage of some of your data.<br/><br/><br/>
          
          
          DATA COLLECTION<br/><br/>
          
          Personal data is the information needed to identify you, for example your name, address, date of birth, e-mail address, mobile phone number, etc. With your consent, personal data is recorded and processed by zanobid. Also other non-personal information may be stored, such as: when you register with zanobid; when you subscribe; when you bid on or win an auction; what payment services you use; your IP address. To protect our customers by minimising the number of places your sensitive payment information is stored, zanobid ensures that payment account or credit card data other than your billing address is never stored. Our website contains forms that directly pass such information on to our payment processor; the only part stored in our system is the service used, the date of the transaction, if it was successful and any error messages provided by the payment processor. As stated above, zanobid’s online services store bidding data with timestamps when credits were placed. This information can be used by zanobid for enhancing zanobid’s online bidding service. It is important to note that no personal data of a user will ever be shared with any third party except where required for the smooth running of the platform or any other zanobid user.<br/><br/><br/>
          
          
          USE OF THE DATA<br/><br/>
          
          Personal data such as name, address, etc. is used to process product delivery after an auction is won. We ask for your email address so that we can stay in contact with you by email.
          
          We also use your personal data to communicate with you regarding orders, to process auctions, marketing retention and to process other transactions. Similarly, we use your data in order to inform you of marketing promotions or to enable third parties authorized by us to perform technical, logistical, or other services. All data is stored securely on our servers.<br/><br/><br/>
          
          EMAIL NEWSLETTERS<br/><br/>
          
          When you register with zanobid, you agree to receive email newsletters. We will use this method to inform you of new functions or special promotions on our website.
          
          You can at any time opt-out of this by changing your settings where applicable.<br/><br/><br/>
          
          
          VIEWING/CHANGING PERSONAL DATA<br/><br/>
          You can access, review and change most of your personal information by logging on to zanobid at any time. You are required to promptly update your personal information if changes occur or information is inaccurate.<br/><br/><br/>
          
          
          THE USE OF COOKIES AT OUR WEBSITE<br/><br/>
          zanobid uses so-called “cookies”, which are alphanumeric identifiers that are stored on your computer that can be retrieved to assist in customizing your experience with the online service. The information saved supports the functionality of the site, for example to recognize your browser and to provide features like keeping track of your visual preferences or controlling the frequency of “pop-up” windows.
          
          You are free to prevent cookies from being saved on your hard drive by adjusting the corresponding settings in your browser. However, turning off these settings may result in limited functionality.<br/><br/><br/>
          
          
          SECURITY MEASURES<br/><br/>
          
          The information in your zanobid account and in your zanobid profile is password protected, so that only you have access to this personal information. Please note that you are not permitted to disclose your password to anyone else.
          
          zanobid will never ask for your password in e-mails that you receive unexpectedly or that you did not request. Please remember to log out of your account and to close your internet browser window when you leave the zanobid site; this is especially important if you use a PC in public locations. At present, this is the safest way to ensure that no one has access to your personal information. We assume no liability for the abuse of login data and passwords used.<br/><br/><br/>
          
          
          PRIVACY POLICY AMENDMENTS<br/><br/>
          We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the new Privacy Policy on zanobid. zanobid reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you. Consequently, you should review this Privacy Policy for changes each time you visit zanobid.
